# Play Framework with Scala.js Showcase
###Scala: 2.11.7, Scala.js: 0.8.2, Play: 2.4.3, Slick: 3.1.0

This project was inspired by [Todo application](http://lihaoyi.github.io/workbench-example-app/todo.html)

This project contains 4 simple examples:

1. Todo application with backend persistence. (InMemory, Slick, Anorm)
1. Hangman (Inspired by [Yii's demo](http://www.yiiframework.com/demos/hangman/))
  This simple game as a Single Page Application shows you the use of client side change propagation by means of [Scala.Rx](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala.rx). A general Scala library which also runs on a JS platform (due its Execution Context abstraction).
  _Smart variables_ are embedded in a page `HTMLElement` producing function (`pageGuess`) will auto-update themselves when the values they depend on change and are placed in a `Rx` block.
  With compile-time pickling aka serialisation aka marshalling the servr will communicate with the client using the shared typeclass `Hangman` which its definition is shared with the JVM server and JS client.
1. HTML5 File upload (Modified from [How to Use HTML5 File Drag and Drop](http://www.sitepoint.com/html5-file-drag-and-drop/))
1. Server Push Chat. It supports both Websocket and Server-Sent Event

This project uses project structure from [play-with-scalajs-example](https://github.com/vmunier/play-with-scalajs-example)
